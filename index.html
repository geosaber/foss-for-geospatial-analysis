<p class="small">
At the Center for Geospatial Analytics at NC State University, we
develop innovative software, applications, and educational materials
for open source geospatial analytics and GIS with a special focus on
environmental modeling, geovisualization, space-time simulations, and
multi-temporal LiDAR data analysis. With open source geospatial tools,
we investigate environmental assessment and sustainable land management
applications, study the dynamics and vulnerability of coastal regions
to investigate the impact of land use change on soil erosion and
deposition, and identify locations with high solar energy potential. We
also explore new techniques for interacting with geospatial data, such
as tangible geospatial modeling, which when coupled with GRASS GIS
supports collaboration, decision-making, and education. Free and open
source software ensures the freedom to use our tools for any purpose,
to review and change the underlying algorithms, and to share the tools
with the research community and general public.
