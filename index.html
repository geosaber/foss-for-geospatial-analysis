<h2>Headings</h2>

The Foundations of the General Public License:
Nobody should be restricted by the software they use.
GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989 for GNU project

There are four freedoms that every user should have:
<ul>
    <li>the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
    <li>the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
    <li>the freedom to share the software 
    <li>the freedom to share the changes you make.
</ul>

<p>
all four lead to >>> Free software

<p>
open source or without pay is not enough
</section>

<section>
<h2>Free and Open Source Software</h2>

<p>
Software that is free to run, study, modify and distribute

<p>
Free means freedom: free is a matter of liberty not price

<p>
It can be commercial (e.g., Red Hat Linux) but not proprietary

Licenses: 
<ul>
    <li>GPL - cannot be combined with closed software binary
    <li>Lesser GPL (LGPL) - allows combined binary, but the GPL part must remain free
    <li>Public domain - can be modified, closed and sold as proprietary http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#SoftwareLicenses 

<p>
GRASS GIS – GPL, GDAL - LGPL 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>FOSS development</h2>
<ul>
    <li>open community of developers and users
    <li>flexible, interoperable and portable
    <li>extensive supporting software tools for code management, bug tracking, documentation, collaboration
    <li>browse the source code on-line
</ul>

<p>
Different from OGC - Open Geospatial Consortium
sets standards for interoperability (similar to Open GL)
both proprietary and open source software follows these 
standards where it is good for them
OSGeo and OGC coordinate their activities

<section>
<h2>Google Summer of Code</h2>
<p>
http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011 

<p>
Google has provided funding ($4500 per student) for the open source projects since 2006 through global competition. 
 
 <p>
Number of projects: 175, Students: 1115
Mentors un-conference: self-organized

<p>
example OSGeo projects: wxNVIZ, v.generalize, WMS for GRASS, 

<p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Code sprints</h2>
Developers working together
<ul>
    <li>open participation
    <li>self organized through wiki
    <li>software development, documentation, data
    <li>often associated with conferences
<ul>

<p>
Examples: Prague, Italy, New York, Montreal

<h2>Open Source Geospatial Foundation</h2>
<p>
By 2005 there was more than 200 foss4g projects: need for selection and organization

<p>
Founding projects (February 2006):<br>
GDAL/OGR, GeoTools, GRASS, Mapbender, MapBuilder, MapGuide Open Source (Autodesk), MapServer, OSSIM

<p>
Mission: To support the development of open source 
geospatial software and promote its widespread use.
</section>

<h2>Open Source Geospatial Foundation</h2>
<p>
Web Mapping:<br>
deegree, geomajas, GeoServer, MapBuilder, Mapbender, MapFish, MapGuide Open Source, MapServer, OpenLayers
<p>
Desktop Applications<br>
GRASS GIS, Quantum GIS, gvSIG
<p>
Geospatial Libraries<br>
FDO (feature data objects), GDAL/OGR, GEOS, GeoTools, MetaCRS, OSSIM, PostGIS
<p>
Metadata Catalog<br>
GeoNetwork
<p>
Data: Open street map
<p>
incubation: license issues cleanup in the code base
</section>

<section>
<h2>Example Desktop System</h2>
Portability, interoperability, Geostatistics Predictive modeling,
View Interact Teach, Spatial Analysis Modeling, Visualize,
Database engine: Tables, attributes, External data
</section>

<section>
<h2>WebGIS integrated services</h2>
update with openlayers, mapfish,python2web
PyWPS: implementation of OGS Web Processing Service standard 
in Python programming language. it has native support for GRASS GIS
WMS/WFS/WMC/SLD Geoserver/Mapserver OpenLayers
</section>

<section>
<h2>GRASS: desktop FOSSGIS</h2>
<p>
1984 developed at USArmy CERL as land management support system, evolved into general purpose GIS
<p>
1999 GPL, international team of developers 
<p>
Portable: all common OS, 32/64bit, code in C
<p>
Interoperability: through GDAL
<p>
Web-based infrastructure: SVN with on-line source code browser, bug reports, users and programmers manual, wiki, IRC

<p>
Commercial support:

<h2>GRASS6 spatial data types</h2>
<p>
2D raster and imagery
2D/3D topological vector 
3D raster (voxels)
</section>

<section>
<h2>GRASS6 functionality</h2>
<ul>
    <li>fully integrated 350+ modules 
    <li>add-ons managed on wiki 
    <li>GEM (GRASS extension manager)

    <li>raster: map algebra, DEM analysis, flow, buffers, neighbourhood analysis, solar, cost surfaces, covariance, 
    <li>image: rectification, multispectral, reclassification, fft
    <li>vector: buffers, overlays, conversions, networks,
    <li>DBMS: attribute management, SQL
    <li>transformations: projections, raster-vector conversions, interpolation/approximation
    <li>visualization: 2D display, 3D visualization, ps maps
    <li>WMS support r.in.wms (web map service, read maps directly from the web), Google earth through v.out.ogr
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>On-line tools</h2>
<p>
Project GEOPARK:
Mapserver implementation provides on-line access to various geospatial data
including radiotracked deer paths (red lines) for the Park of Stelvio, Italy.
