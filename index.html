<h2>Four freedoms</h2>

<ul>
<li>There are four freedoms that <em>user</em> should have:
<ul>
    <li>the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
    <li>the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
    <li>the freedom to share the software,
    <li>the freedom to share the changes you make.
</ul>
<li>by Richard Stallman and Free Software Foundation
<li>Nobody should be restricted by the software they use.
<li>GNU General Public License
<li>free software
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Free, Libre and Open Source</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>for free</em> (at no cost) is not enough
<li>free software is free to run, study, modify and distribute
<li>free is a matter of liberty not price
<ul>
    <li><em>free as in freedom</em> (as opposed to <em>free as in free beer</em>)</li>
    <li><em>libre</em> as opposed to <em>gratis</em></li>
</ul>
<li>also: free software != freeware
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Free, Libre and Open Source</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>open source</em> (only) is not enough
<li>open source code
<ul>
    <li>publicly and easily accessible
</ul>
<li>Stallman's four freedoms require having the source code
<ul>
    <li>but just having the source code doesn't imply the freedoms
</ul>
<li>open source means also open development, open community, open discussions, ...
<ul>
    <li>not only the possibility to see the source code
</ul>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Free, Libre and Open Source</h2>

<ul>
<li>free software (FS), open source software (OSS), free and open source software (FOSS), free, libre and open source software (FLOSS)
<li>the term <em>open source</em> is often used for simplicity
<li>the term <em>open source</em> is often used by developers as it refers to a development model
<li>the term <em>FOSS</em> is often used in geospatial community
<ul>
    <li>free refers to user's freedom
</ul>

</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Commercial and FOSS</h2>

<ul>
<li>FOSS can be used commercially
<li>FOSS can be commercial but not proprietary
<li>Famous examples:
<ul>
    <li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    <li><a href="https://code.facebook.com/projects/">Facebook</a>,
        <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/200-libby-clark/787161-how-amazon-web-services-uses-linux-and-open-source">Amazon</a>,
        <a href="https://netflix.github.io/">Netflix</a>
</ul>
<li>reason: no vendor lock-in
</ul>

<h2>Commercial and FOSS</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
Microsoft loves Linux

<!--Neil McAllister, The Register, October 20, 2014-->
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
Apple uses software created by the Open Source community and returns its enhancements to the community.

<h2>Why industry uses open source</h2>
<ul>
    <li>vendor neutrality
    <ul>
        <li>proprietary software has a single vendor (vendor lock-in)
        <li>open source software is independent on particular companies
        <li>open source is not influenced by vendor's current business goals
    </ul>
    <li>flexibility <span class="small">(use where you want, when you want)</span>
    <li>interoperability
    <ul>
        <li>open source aims to support standards
        <li>proprietary software often uses propriety formats
    </ul>
    <li>cost <span class="small">(no license fees, no license management)</span>
    <ul>
        <li>low total cost of ownership
            <span class="small">(includes cost to upgrade or migrate)</span>
    </ul>
    <li>support <span class="small">(many free options available by default)</span>
    <ul>
        <li>money not spent on license fees used for support or features
    </ul>
    <li>influence in development <span class="small">(direct access to developers)</span>
</ul>

<h2>FOSS licenses</h2>
<ul>
<li>free software licenses (according to four freedoms by FSF)
<ul>
    <li>GNU GPL
    <li>code cannot be combined with proprietary (and closed) code into one program
    <li>examples: Linux, R, GRASS GIS, QGIS
</ul>
<li>permissive licenses
<ul>
    <li>BSD, MIT
    <li>source code can be modified, closed and sold as proprietary
    <li>more options for the developer (can make the new software proprietary)
    <li>less freedoms for the user (might not get the source code, thus freedoms)
    <li>example: GDAL used in QGIS as well as in ArcGIS
</ul>
<!--
<li>specialized licenses
<ul>
    <li>GNU LGPL &ndash; allows mixing proprietary and free software
    <li>GNU AGPL &ndash; more freedoms for user using software "in cloud"
</ul>
<li>licenses usually not used for source code
<ul>
    <li>CC licenses &ndash; texts, images, documentation, artwork
    <li>public domain &ndash; often not used but some licenses are similar
</ul>
-->
</ul>

</section>


<section>
<h2>FOSS licenses</h2>
<ul>
<li>licenses are mostly important for the developers
<li>users don't have to worry about the license
<ul>
    <li>as long as they know that the software is under some known license
    <li>lists of known licenses:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses">OSI list of licenses</a>
            <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">GNU (FSF) list of licenses</a>
            <li><a href="http://choosealicense.com">ChooseALicense.com</a></li>
        </ul>
</ul>
<li>this is different from proprietary software
<ul>
    <li>user must read and agree to EULA or similar type of agreement
    <li>license is used in meaning license to use
        <ul>
            <li>often paid or limited (or both) for proprietary software
        </ul>
    <li>applies to paid software, freeware, online services, ...
</ul>

<p>

</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>FOSS development</h2>
<ul>
    <li>open community of developers and users
    <ul>
        <li>may include individuals and companies
    </ul>
    <li>flexible, interoperable and portable
    <li>extensive supporting software tools for code management, bug tracking, documentation, collaboration
    <li>browse the source code on-line
    <li>anybody can modify but only selected changes go to the original project
</ul>

</section>

<section>
<h2>Standardization</h2>
<p>
Standardization and open source are different but often related.

<p>
OSGeo different from OGC - Open Geospatial Consortium
sets standards for interoperability (similar to OpenGL)
both proprietary and open source software follows these
standards where it is good for them
<p>
OSGeo and OGC coordinate their activities.
